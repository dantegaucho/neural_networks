    "#### Understanding Neural Networks and Tensors\n",
    "Neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure of the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected units called neurons, organized into an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. These networks are designed to learn patterns in data by adjusting the weights of connections between neurons through a process called training. The hidden layers are especially important, as they transform the input data using weighted sums and activation functions to capture complex relationships and features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In deep learning, data is represented using tensors, which are multi-dimensional arrays. A tensor can take various forms: a scalar (0D), a vector (1D), a matrix (2D), or higher-dimensional arrays (3D and beyond). For instance, images are commonly represented as 3D tensorsâ€”height, width, and color channels (e.g., RGB). So, a 64x64 pixel image with 3 channels would be a tensor of shape [64, 64, 3]. Tensors are foundational to how data flows through a neural network and are essential to model computation."
